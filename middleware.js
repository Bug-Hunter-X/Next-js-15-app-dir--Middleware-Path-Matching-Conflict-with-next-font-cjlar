In Next.js 15, a rather uncommon bug can occur when using the `app` directory and server components along with a custom middleware function that attempts to modify the response based on the request path.  If the middleware function uses a regular expression to match paths that may conflict with the `next/font` module's internal routing, it can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the font not loading correctly or other rendering issues. This is because Next.js's internal mechanisms for handling fonts may clash with custom middleware path matching.
